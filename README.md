# LightweightARFoundation

Bare bones Unity project with AR Foundation using the Lightweight 
Render Pipeline (LWRP) version 5.13

A mashup of 
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/LWRP-CustomRendererExamples/ and
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/ as a workaround
that allows rendering of the camera background with the latest versions of
the LWRP.

Only tested with ARKit.
